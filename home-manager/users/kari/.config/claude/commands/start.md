Investigate and plan implementation for: $ARGUMENTS

## Investigation Phase

1. **Context Analysis**
   - Read CLAUDE.md for project guidelines
   - Analyze existing codebase architecture
   - Understand current patterns and dependencies
   - Identify integration points

2. **Requirements Clarification**
   - Parse the request for explicit requirements
   - Identify implicit requirements
   - Note any ambiguities to clarify

## Planning Phase

Create a comprehensive implementation plan:

1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - How does this fit the existing codebase?
   - What patterns should be followed?
   - What dependencies are needed?

2. **Implementation Steps**
   - Break down into discrete, testable steps
   - Identify potential blockers
   - Note areas requiring user input

3. **Quality Considerations**
   - Avoid superficial solutions
   - Make the solution dynamic and scalable
   - Ensure data-driven implementation
   - No magic values or hard-coded fallbacks

## Output

Present the plan and iterate with the user. Ask for clarification on unclear requirements before proceeding.
