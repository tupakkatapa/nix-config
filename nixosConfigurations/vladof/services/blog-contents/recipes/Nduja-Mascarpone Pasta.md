*Serves 3, 15 min*

This creamy pasta balances the spiciness and meatiness of nduja, creating a perfectly satisfying meal.

## Ingredients
- Fusilli pasta: 300g
- Mascarpone: 200g
- Nduja sausage spread: 1 ½ tbsp, to taste
- Pasta cooking water: 1 dl
- Garlic paste: 1 tsp
- Onion: 1 medium, finely chopped
- Beef bouillon cube: 1
- Salt: 1 tsp
- Black pepper: 1 tsp

## Preparation
1. Cook the pasta in salted water along with the beef bouillon cube. Reserve 1 dl of the cooking water before draining.
2. While the pasta is cooking, sauté the chopped onion in a small pot over medium heat until translucent.
3. Add the mascarpone, garlic paste, and nduja to the pot. Stir until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy. Adjust the nduja amount to suit your spice tolerance and the specific nduja you are using.
4. Pour in the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce to a runnier consistency. Season with freshly ground black pepper.
5. Drain the pasta and combine it with the sauce, stirring until evenly coated.
