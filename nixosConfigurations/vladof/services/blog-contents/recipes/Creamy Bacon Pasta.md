# Creamy Bacon Pasta

*Serves 4-5, 30-40 min*

A simple "mix everything" dish, perfect for those seeking something uncomplicated, quick, and tasty. This is nothing fancy, unhealthy, and great for a hangover. I would be careful about adding extra salt because of the sodium content of the bacon and ham. I prefer not to add salt in the cooking process at all. I think I got this recipe from one of my exes, which is probably the only good thing that came out of that relationship.

## Ingredients
- Fusilli pasta: 400g (14 oz)
- Bacon: 170g (6 oz)
- Diced ham: 200g (7 oz)
- Crème fraîche (garlic and herbs flavor): 200g (7 oz)
- Onion: 1 medium
- Cooking cream: 2dl (0.7 cup)
- Basil & Black pepper

## Preparation
1. Cook the fusilli pasta according to the package instructions.
2. While the pasta cooks, chop the bacon into small pieces. Peel and finely chop the onion.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onion and bacon pieces until the bacon starts to crisp.
4. Add the ham strips and cook until they heat up or even are lightly browned.
5. Lower the heat and add the crème fraîche and cooking cream to the skillet. Stir to combine and gently heat through, and season to your taste.

### Serving
Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing well to ensure the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce. You can also serve the pasta and the sauce separately to offer the possibility of playing with the ratio. Oh, and if you think the sauce is too thick, add a little pasta water or more cooking cream to reach your desired consistency. Serve hot, with additional seasoning on top if desired.
