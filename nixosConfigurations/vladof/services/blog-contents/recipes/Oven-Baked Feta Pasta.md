*Serves 2, 30-40 min*

This was a viral food trend from 2019. I should try this with some meat; maybe you will, but I never dare risk it because I know it's very tasty without.

## Ingredients
- Penne pasta: 250g (8.8 oz)
- Feta cheese: 200g (7 oz)
- Olive oil: 1dl (1/2 cup)
- Red chili pepper: 1-2, to taste
- Cherry tomatoes: 200g (7 oz)
- Basil, Salt & Black pepper

## Preparation
1. Begin by preheating your oven to 200°C (392°F). Lightly coat the bottom of a baking dish with a bit of the olive oil.
2. Place the feta cheese block at the center of the dish, then sprinkle the sliced chili pepper over the cheese.
3. Arrange the cherry tomatoes around the feta, drizzling both the tomatoes and cheese with the bulk of the olive oil. Season with black pepper and a dash of salt.
4. Bake for 15 minutes at the set temperature. Afterwards, increase the oven temperature to 225°C (437°F) and switch to the grill setting. Move the dish to a higher rack and grill for approximately 10 minutes, until the tomatoes begin to burst and the feta turns a slight golden brown. Monitor closely to avoid burning.
5. Meanwhile, cook the penne pasta as per the package's directions and drain.
6. Once the baking dish is out of the oven, use a fork to gently mash the feta and tomatoes into a creamy sauce.
7. Stir the cooked pasta into the dish, ensuring it's thoroughly coated with the sauce.

### Serving
Serve warm, adorned with fresh basil leaves for an added burst of flavor.
