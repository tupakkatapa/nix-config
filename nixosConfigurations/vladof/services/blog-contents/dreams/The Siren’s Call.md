# The Siren's Call

*Imagined 2024-02-10, transcribed by AI, cared by me*

## Chapter 1: The First Awakening

I woke to the sound of a siren, its piercing wail cutting through the stillness of the night. For a moment, I lay there, groggy and disoriented, trying to make sense of it. Then it hit me — this was no ordinary alarm. Something was happening.

I threw off the covers, rushed to the window, and pulled back the curtains. Midnight had turned the world dark, except for the streaks of light that raced across the sky — missiles, moving with purpose. Moments later, they struck, their impact reverberating through the air and shaking the ground. An attack had begun.

## Chapter 2: The Second Awakening

When I opened my eyes again, I was on the upper deck of a bus. Night surrounded us, and the vehicle swayed gently as it moved. Everyone else was asleep, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I held a backpack and a sports bag, clutching them tightly as if they contained something precious.

The dark scenery outside offered little comfort. Then, the streaks of light returned, carving through the night sky. The bus came to a sudden stop, and instinct took over. I grabbed my belongings and scrambled outside, seeking safety.

Once I was out, I realized I had left my sports bag behind. The bus itself was strange, with no windows on the upper level and only a windshield at the front. Metal bars lined the sides like a framework. I climbed them quickly, retrieved the bag, and descended just in time to see the missiles pass overhead. They didn’t strike nearby, instead flying far above us.

Relieved, I climbed the bars again, this time holding both my backpack and sports bag. I reached the upper section and tried to reenter the bus through the front, but the passengers wouldn’t let me.

“You’re contaminated,” someone said, their tone cold and distant.

They believed the missiles had released something harmful into the air. I tried to explain that the missiles had flown far above us, that there was no danger. But my protests fell on deaf ears. The bus started moving again, slowly at first. Determined not to be left behind, I clung to the bars on the side, holding tight as it rolled forward.

We traveled this way for some time, the bus maintaining a low speed. My arms ached from the strain, and the rumble of the engine made it hard to think. Then, out of nowhere, a man appeared on the roadside. He held a long butterfly net, its frame gleaming faintly in the dark.

Without hesitation, he extended the net and swept it over me, pulling me off the bus. I fell to the ground as the bus continued on its way, its taillights shrinking into the distance. Alone again, I stood and dusted myself off, driven by one thought: I had to reach wherever the bus was going.

## Chapter 3: Meeting the Stranger

I wandered through the city streets, the night quiet save for the sound of my footsteps. The buildings around me were dark and empty, the streets lit only by scattered streetlamps. I had no idea where the bus had gone, but a passerby pointed me in the right direction.

“Turn right at the next intersection,” they said, gesturing with their hand.

I thanked them and moved on, though I realized the path forward was clear regardless. Past the intersection, I spotted another figure moving with urgency. He was coming from the opposite direction but seemed to share my purpose.

“Do you speak English?” I asked when we crossed paths.

“Yes,” he replied.

I hesitated, then asked, “Are you Japanese?”

He nodded, and I told him I spoke a little Japanese as well. He explained he was heading to the coast and had a plan to escape. Not knowing where the bus was headed, I asked if I could join him. He agreed, and together we continued through the city.

The sirens blared again, cutting through the stillness. We turned and saw the missiles streaking toward us. Their sound grew louder with every passing second. We sprinted, taking cover against a brick wall just as they struck a nearby building. The explosion sent dust and debris flying, filling the air with a choking haze.

When the dust settled, I saw that the man was injured. His leg was bleeding, the fabric of his cargo pants torn. He cursed under his breath, explaining that a map and important contact information had been in his now-destroyed pocket. Despite the injury, he assured me he could keep going. He knew of a building nearby where we might find help.

## Chapter 4: The Hidden Room

The building he led us to was old and abandoned, its corridors winding and confusing. We moved cautiously, the silence broken only by our footsteps. Eventually, we found a room that seemed untouched by time.

It had the feeling of a lived-in space, with a large sofa, a coffee table, a bookshelf, and a television. There was another door leading to a smaller room, which we opened out of curiosity. The second room was cramped, its ceiling slanted sharply like the underside of a staircase. At first glance, it seemed empty, but the man lifted part of the ceiling, revealing a hidden mattress.

On it lay a man, his body thin and his face weary. My companion seemed relieved to see him, speaking quickly in Japanese. I assumed this was the contact he had hoped to find. Wanting to give them privacy, I returned to the larger room to catch my breath.

## Chapter 5: Strangers and Laughter

I wasn’t alone for long. Two men entered the room, their demeanor casual and familiar. They sat down as if they belonged, introducing themselves with easy smiles.

As we talked, I realized I didn’t know where I was. “Near Turku,” one of them said, answering my unspoken question. The coast was close now.

Their humor was infectious, lightening the weight of the night. At one point, I remembered my phone was nearly dead. I asked if they had a charger, and one of them handed me a strange contraption with multiple cords.

As I struggled to find the right connection, he offered to help, taking my phone to check. While I chatted with the other man, I glanced over to see the first one browsing an adult website on my phone.

“Really?” I said with a laugh, snatching it back. “First chance you get, and you’re looking at that?”

He laughed, handing me another charger. “You owe us now,” he joked.

“Fair enough,” I replied. “I’ll repay the favor.”

## Chapter 6: A Glimpse of Familiarity

As my phone charged, I decided to sort through my belongings, discarding anything unnecessary. My sports bag held clothes, towels, a hard drive, and a zip-lock bag filled with bottles. I carefully packed items I needed to keep dry, preparing for the next leg of the journey.

From the smaller room, three women emerged. I hadn’t seen any other exits, so their appearance surprised me. They were friendly, two older and one younger. I asked if I could leave some of my belongings behind, and they agreed.

As I unpacked, I noticed one of the women looked familiar. Between conversations, I stole glances at her, trying to place where I’d seen her before. Finally, I asked, “You wouldn’t happen to be Siiri, would you?”

She smiled and nodded. “I was in Kiikeli when the war began.” *(Kiikeli is a place in my city)*

Her words lingered, carrying a weight that felt both distant and immediate. We spoke briefly about the past, and before long, I woke up, the dream dissolving into the morning light.
