My name is Jesse, I am currently located in Oulu, Finland, and willing to consider moving to another city or country. I have been involved in education and work focusing on construction but recently have found a passion for software engineering. My skills revolve around Linux, scripting, networking and a bit of web development, with a particular focus on NixOS. I am especially interested in learning Rust as my go-to programming language. Whether I have zero or moderate knowledge in a particular area, I always consider my best qualities to be creativity, curiosity, willingness to learn, and Finnish "[sisu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu)".
