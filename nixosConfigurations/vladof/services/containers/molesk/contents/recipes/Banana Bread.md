*Serves 6, 70 min*

This easy banana bread recipe is perfect for using up those overripe bananas that nobody wants to eat. It's not too sweet either, and leaving it a bit undercooked in the middle gives some cookie dough vibes. It's a reliable recipe for a nice treat that lasts a couple of days.

## Ingredients
- Overripe bananas: 3
- Butter: 75g, melted
- Baking soda: 1 tsp
- Salt: 1/4 tsp
- Sugar: 2 dl
- Eggs: 2
- Vanilla sugar: 1 tsp
- Cinnamon: 1 tsp
- All-purpose flour: 3.5 dl

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 175°C.
2. Mash the peeled bananas with a fork until smooth. Mix in the melted butter.
3. Lightly beat the eggs into the mixture, then mix in the baking soda, sugars, salt and cinnamon.
4. Finally, add the flour and mix well, until the batter is smooth.
5. Pour the batter into a loaf pan brushed with oil and bake on the middle rack of the oven for about 50 minutes.
6. Remove the bread from the oven, let it cool completely, and then turn it out of the pan.

### Tips
- You can check doneness with a toothpick; if it comes out clean, the bread is ready.
- You may need to adjust the time depending on your oven. If the bread is about to burn on top but is raw inside, in an emergency, remove the bread from the pan, slice it into several pieces and bake on a baking sheet for a while. It's not pretty but does not affect the taste.
