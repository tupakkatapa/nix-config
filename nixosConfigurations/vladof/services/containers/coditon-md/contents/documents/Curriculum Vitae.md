# Curriculum Vitae

My name is Jesse, I am currently located in Oulu, Finland. I have been involved in education and work focusing on construction but recently have found a passion for software engineering. My skills revolve around Linux, scripting, networking and a bit of web development, with a particular focus on NixOS. I am especially interested in learning Rust as my go-to programming language. Whether I have zero or moderate knowledge in a particular area, I always consider my best qualities to be creativity, curiosity, willingness to learn, and Finnish "[sisu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu)".

Skills from my point of view (rated on a scale from 1 to 5): Bash (4), iPXE (4), Nix (4), Python (4), Git (3), Linux (3), Networking (3), Ethereum (2), Virtualization (2), HTML/CSS (1), JavaScript (1), LLM (1), Rust (1). If anything else comes to mind, I'm ready to learn it.
