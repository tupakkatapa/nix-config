# Garlic Spread Ham Box

*Serves 6, 1 hour*

Discovered by accident. Bought some garlic spread for rye bread I didn't end up liking, and the spread ended up sitting in the fridge. One day I was making some ham casserole, and decided to throw it into the mix so it wouldn't go to waste. It ended up being very good, definitely something I'll add to the rotation of everyday food as it's simple. With just cream the casserole will often end up very runny, this fixes that too.

## Ingredients

- 4 dl heavy cream
- 500g frozen potato strip
- 300g garlic spread (maybe 200g, should also try seasoned crème fraîche)
- 200g ham strip
- 1 red onion
- 1/2 tsp salt
- black pepper

## Preparation

1. Pre-heat the oven to 225°C
2. Finely chop the onion.
3. Mix the onion, potato strips, and ham strips in an oven dish.
4. Mix the garlic spread and heavy cream in a bowl, and pour it into the oven dish.
5. Give it a last mix, level the top by pressing with spatula.
6. Bake in the middle part of the oven for about 1 hour until the surface is nice and brown spotted.
