*Serves 8, total 30 minutes active time (plus at least 3 hours for solidification)*

The greatest pastry ever to be invented since I do not enjoy over-sweet desserts. The mango offers a refreshing and exotic flavor that's hard to resist in any shape or form. Perfect for having with a cup of coffee when your friends are over. We need bowls, a lot of bowls.

## Ingredients

### Crust
- Whole grain digestive biscuits: 200g
- Butter: 90g

### Filling
- Gelatin sheets: 5
- Whipping cream: 2dl
- Passion-mango (or just mango) quark: 200g
- Cream cheese: 200g
- Mango puree: 2dl
- Sugar: 1dl

### Glaze
- Mango puree: 3dl
- Gelatin sheets: 3

## Preparation
1. Finely crush the biscuits. Combine with melted butter and press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a springform pan lined with parchment paper.
2. Soak gelatin sheets in cold water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whip the cream until stiff peaks form.
3. In a separate bowl, blend the quark, cream cheese, mango puree, and sugar.
4. Boil a small amount of water, then dissolve the soaked gelatin sheets in it.
5. Carefully mix the gelatin solution into the mango-quark mixture. Follow this by folding in the whipped cream.
6. Transfer the filling over the biscuit base, smoothing the top. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to firm up. Time for a nap ðŸ˜´
7. For the glaze, repeat the gelatin process with the remaining mango puree. Pour it over the set filling, smoothing out the surface of the glaze. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
