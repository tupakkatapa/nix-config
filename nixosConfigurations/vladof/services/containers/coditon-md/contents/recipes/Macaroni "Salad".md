*Serves 4-6, 20 min*

Simple and convenient macaroni salad recipe. I used to make 2 batches of this back to back when I worked in construction, since we didn't always have a microwave or restaurant close by, or wanted to save a bit of money by not going to a restaurant each day. Stores well in a cooler until lunch break.

## Ingredients

- 200g elbow macaroni
- 200g ham
- 200g frozen peas
- 200g strong tasting cheese (gouda, port salut or similar)
- 100g pickles
- 100g sour cream
- 0.5dl mayo
- 1 tbsp mustard

### Spices
- 1/2 tsp salt
- garlic powder
- onion powder
- black pepper

## Preparation
1. Cook the macaroni according to package instructions, drain, mix with the peas and let cool.
2. Dice the ham, cheese, and pickles into small cubes.
3. Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl.
4. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and spices.

## Serving
- Eat cold, do not heat up :D
